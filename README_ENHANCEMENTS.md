## üåü Features Showcase

### Globe Interaction
- **Auto-rotation** when not simulating
- **Country markers** for all major nations
- **Hover effects** and selection feedback
- **Information panels** with country details
- **Smooth camera transitions** during impact simulations

### Impact Visualization
- **Animated impact point** with pulsing effects
- **Expanding rings** for crater, thermal, and shockwave zones
- **Color-coded damage zones** (red for crater, orange for thermal, yellow for shockwave)
- **Realistic scaling** based on physics calculations

### UI Polish
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Accessibility features** with proper ARIA labels
- **Loading states** and error handling
- **Smooth transitions** between all states
- **Professional styling** with consistent design language

## üé® Design Philosophy

The enhanced UI follows these principles:
- **Cinematic Experience**: Movie-like visuals and animations
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Realistic physics and data visualization
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive controls and clear feedback
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations and efficient rendering
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast, labels, and keyboard navigation

## üîß Technical Notes

- The globe uses fallback textures if external resources fail to load
- All animations are optimized for performance
- The app gracefully handles different screen sizes
- Country data is loaded dynamically from JSON files
- Impact calculations use realistic physics formulas
